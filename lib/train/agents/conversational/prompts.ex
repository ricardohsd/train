        TOOLS
        ------
        Assistant can ask the user to use tools to look up information that may be helpful in answering the users original question. The tools the human can use are:

        {tools}

        {format_instructions}

        USER'S INPUT
        --------------------
        Here is the user's input (remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else):

        {input}
        """
        |> String.trim(),
      scratchpad:
        """
        TOOL RESPONSE:
        ---------------------
        {observation}

        USER'S INPUT
        --------------------

        Okay, so what is the response to my last comment? If using information obtained from the tools you must mention it explicitly without mentioning the tool names - I have forgotten all TOOL RESPONSES! Remember to respond with a markdown code snippet of a json blob with a single action, and NOTHING else.

# Train üöÇüöÇüöÇ

`Train` is an attempt of providing a set of tools for building applications with LLM. This project is heavily inspired on [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain).

This has been extracted from a personal project and it is still on its first steps.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:train, "~> 0.0.1-dev"}
  ]
end
```

## Examples

### Conversational agent
Designed to be used on conversational scenarios. It will use the given tools, and buffers the memory to remember previous conversations.
```elixir
{:ok, memory_pid} = Train.Memory.BufferAgent.start_link()
tools = [Train.Tools.BasicCalculator, Train.Tools.SerpApi]
chain = Train.LlmChain.new(%{memory_pid: memory_pid, tools: tools})

{:ok, response} = chain |> Train.Chains.ConversationChain.run("Who is Angela Merkel?")
# Angela Dorothea Merkel is a German former politician and scientist who served as Chancellor of Germany from November 2005 to December 2021. A member of the Christian Democratic Union, she previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union from 2000 to 2018.

{:ok, response} = chain |> Train.Chains.ConversationChain.run("Where was she born?")
# Angela Merkel was born in Hamburg, Germany.
```

### Vector ask agent
Allows asking questions to documents ingested on Pinecone.
Example: Given that cooking recipes were ingested on the `food` namespace, the following can be used to retrieve recipes.
```elixir
chain =
  Train.LlmChain.new(%{
    pinecone_config: %Train.Clients.Pinecone.Config{namespace: "food", topK: 5}
  })
{:ok, history, response} =
  Train.Agents.VectorAgent.call(chain, "How to bake p√£o de queijo?", Train.Agents.VectorPrompt)
```

## Goals
- [] Implement other types of memory buffer like window and summary explained on this [post](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langchain-conversational-memory/).
- [] Create other tools like: Wikipedia, Wolfram, PostgreSQL/MySQL.
- [] Implement a Zero Shot React agent.
- [] Implement a buffer memory backed by a SQL storage.
